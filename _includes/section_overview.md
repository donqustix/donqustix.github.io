# About me

Welcome to my personal website. I am a software developer and part-time writer. I have been using computers and the internet for a long time now and I love to play with all of the cool apps for my phone and my tablet. In fact, I spend most of my free time playing with Minecraft, a game which I love to play with my son and my friends.

I also spend a lot of time on software projects related to desktop publishing, various programming languages and I am involved in the Open Source community. I am the maintainer of this website. I started this website to help me organize my posts about using Linux for programming and the things I write on my blog about using free software and the Internet for the benefit of everyone.

Enjoy your visit.
