# About me

My journey as a software developer began many years ago when I was tired of playing video games and wanted to create my own. At that time, I was spending most of my free time playing Minecraft, and at one moment, it soon became apparent that I could get involved in programming by making modifications, which were being written in Java â€“ and it was the first programming language I learned.

So, video games were the crucial accelerator that prompted me to gain interest in programming, and after a while, I got some experience that allowed me to feel confident in what I do and quickly seek needed information on the Internet.

One day, while surfing YouTube, I had stumbled upon a few channels that had influenced me to be the person I am today, leading me into learning C++. I believe that, like anything in this world, programming is a form of art, and from my perspective, C++ enables one to create a piece of art to the fullest. The ideology of viewing programming as a form of art has been helping me to this day to continuously polish my skills.

I appreciate people who are eager to learn new things, and I myself try to display this quality. My hobbies are playing Go, a worldwide popular board game, and maintaining my website.
