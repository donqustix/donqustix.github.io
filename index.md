I'm an ambitious software engineer who spends his free time on ping-ponging from procrastination to learning new things that cover such fields of study as Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Physics.

## Projects
* A cycle-accurate [NES emulator](https://github.com/donqustix/emunes/) written in C++17 & SDL2 with sound support.
* A multi-threaded [computer game](https://github.com/donqustix/colvox-cpp) written in modern C++ using OpenGL. The game allows players to design buildings in a cubic world.
* Yet another home-made [Gameboy emulator](https://github.com/donqustix/emugaboy) written in C++.
* A Worms-like [computer game](https://github.com/donqustix/pixorms) written in C++.
